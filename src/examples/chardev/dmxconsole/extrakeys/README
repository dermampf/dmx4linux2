ABOUT:
The following steps described in this file are nessesary to add
some more function keys to your system.



To add the rest of the function keys, usualy F21..F63 you need to
load the keymap file 'dmxconsole.kmap' using loadkeys:

$ loadkeys dmxconsole.kmap

Then you need to add the entries in the file termcap-dmxconsole
to your linux terminal. After that you need to call tic to let
it transfer your termcap file into terminfo files, that are used by curses.

$ tic /etc/termcap

Now you should be able to use the keypad to your right with dmxconsole.
